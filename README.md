# testmark.js

**Language-agnostic test fixtures in Markdown**

_Based on the Go [reference implementation](https://github.com/warpfork/go-testmark)_

> Wanna write test fixtures and example data in a language-agnostic way?
>
> Wanna be able to display those fixtures and examples in the middle of the docs you're already writing?
>
> Wanna be confident that your docs are also actually telling the truth, because your tests are executing directly on the example data in the docs?
>
> Are those docs already in markdown, and all you need is some glue code to read it (and maybe even patch it) programmatically?
>
> Welcome to `testmark`. You might like it.

See https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/warpfork/go-testmark for full documentation about how to write Markdown documents which embed testmark test fixture data.

See [example.md](./example.md) for a plain testmark example document, and [exampleWithDirs.md](./exampleWithDirs.md) for an example using paths as test names (for use with `index()`).

## API

The following functions are named exports of the package:

```js
import { parse, index, patch, toString } from 'testmark.js'
```

### `parse(md: string): Document`

Parse a Markdown document and return a testmark `Document` object containing the fixture data contained within.

See below for `Document` object specification.

### `index(document: Document): DirEnt`

Take a testmark `Document` (from a `parse()`) and return a `DirEnt` that represents the test fixture data as a directory and file structure. See [exampleWithDirs.md](./exampleWithDirs.md) for an example document. Test data can be navigated through the `DirEnt` structure as if it were a set of directories and files.

See below for `DirEnt` object specification.

### `patch(document: Document, hunks: Hunk[]): Document`

Take an existing testmark `Document` (from a `parse()`) and return a new `Document` that has been patched with new fixture data provided as an array of `Hunk` objects.

This operation is useful for filling in a Markdown document with output generated from programmatic fixture data generation. A skeleton Markdown document can be created and combined with data to form the output document. Hunks will be name matched with testmark fixture elements in the document, with the new data being inserted at that point. Hunks with names that don't appear in the existing document will be appended to the end.

The resulting `Document`'s `original` field will contain a stringified form of the document which can be written to file.

See below for `Hunk` object specification.

### `toString(document: Document): string`

A simple utility function that renders a testmark `Document` cleanly to a string for output. In most cases, the `original` property should be enough and this utility won't be needed.

## Types

### `Document`

```typescript
interface Document {
  /*
   * The original document, complete, but split into lines. We always save this,
   * because if we are going to write this document back out, it's going to be
   * by patching this.
   */
  original: string

  /*
   * The document, sliced into lines. Useful because we made it during parse
   * anyway, and it can save us a lot of work during edits.
   */
  lines: string[]

  /*
   * Each data hunk. Contains just offset information, and the parsed name
   * header. Is in order of hunk appearance.
   */
  dataHunks: DocHunk[]

  /*
   * Data hunks in Map form so we can easily reference them by name.
   */
  hunksByName: Map<string, DocHunk>
}
```

### `Hunk`

Provide objects of this form to `patch()`:

```typescript
interface Hunk {
  /*
   * The hunk name (e.g. whatever comes after `[testmark]:# ` and before any
   * more whitespace). Cannot be empty.
   */
  name: string

  /*
   * The code block syntax hint (or more literally: anything that comes after
   * the triple-tick that starts the code block). Usually we don't encourage use
   * of this much in testmark, but it's here.  Can be empty.
   */
  blockTag: string

  /*
   * The full body of the hunk, as bytes.
   */
  body: string
}
```

### `DocHunk`

`DocHunk` extends `Hunk` and adds document-local information that are not expected for `patch()` operations:

```typescript
interface DocHunk extends Hunk {
  /*
   * Index into Document.Original where the comment block is found. The code
   * block indicator is necessarily is the following line, and the code block
   * body one line after that.
   * Note that this is zero-indexed.  You probably want to +1 before printing to
   * a human.
   */
  lineStart: number

  /*
   * Index into Document.Original that contains the closing code block
   * indicator.
   */
  lineEnd: number
}
```

### `DirEnt`

`DirEnt` objects can be navigated as directory & file structures by using the `children` map where `hunk` is `null` (a "directory"), and the `hunk` property where `children` is null (a "file").

```typescript
export interface DirEnt {
  /*
   * The name of just this path segment.
   * Note that if there's a Hunk in this DirEnt, its name may be differentâ€”it
   * still has the *full* path name.
   */
  name: string

  /*
   * A hunk, or null.
   */
  hunk: Hunk | null

  /*
   * Children, recursively as a named map, if any exist.
   */
  children: Map<string, DirEnt> | null

  /*
   * Children, recursively as an ordered list, if any exist.
   */
  childrenList: DirEnt[] | null
}
```

## Note regarding Windows

Ideally when we're relying on text files for test data input we'd want to have byte-perfect representations of fixtures, but this presents some problems for Windows. By default (unless the user has changed the settings), git on Windows will convert line endings to Windows style which include a carriage return (`\r`) character. This isn't good, because we don't know whether these characters are part of our fixture data or not!

So, testmark takes a rather brute-force approach to this problem and just strips out carriage return characters when they appear with a line-ending. In practice this _may_ impact the byte-perfect requirements for test fixtures, so you should be careful when using data that strays outside of standard printable character range, especially when control characters get involved. This is a text file format, if your data isn't text, then make it text by encoding in hex or base64 or something that reduces the character set to the safe range.

The `Document#original` property and `toString()` function are going to result in text that only uses UNIX line endings (`\n`). So even your input document will be transformed if it does a round-trip through testmark on Windows. Be warned!

## Note about the package name

Yes, `.js` extensions to packages such, but once upon a time, [Mark made a test](https://www.npmjs.com/package/test-mark) package and published it to npm, with only a package.json. npm now includes automatic typosquatting detection which they apparently cannot manually override, so nobody can publish a `testmark` package because of this. npm also refuses to remove `test-mark` even though it is a trivial package with no code in it which is in contravention with npm rules: ["Package names are considered squatted if the package has no genuine function."](https://docs.npmjs.com/policies/disputes). Yay.
